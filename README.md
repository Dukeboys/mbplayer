# MusicBrainz Player project

The majority of the documentation for this project is contained in the docs
directory as a Sphinx documentation set.  The built documentation is available
on the ReadTheDocs site: [ReadTheDocs Latest MusicBrainz Player Documentation]
(http://mbplayer.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).

Put breadcrums here to direct people to different places.  Information about
the latest release, link to a changelog and so on will eventually go here too.
