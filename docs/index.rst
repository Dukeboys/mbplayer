Welcome to MusicBrainz Player's documentation!
==============================================

MusicBrainz Player is a music player application that fully utilizes the metadata and artwork made
available through the MusicBrainz database.  The documentation is divided into two main areas:
User documentation on how to use the application; and the Developer documentation on the design of
the application and other information useful to developers.
