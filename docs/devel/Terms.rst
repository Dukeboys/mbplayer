Definitions of Terms
====================

-  | **Album** An album is one or more discs each containing one or more
     tracks. This collection is published as an
   | atomic unit and includes artwork on the cover and in inserted
     materials in the form of booklets, liner notes,
   | and posters.

-  | **Disc** A physical piece of media that is always part of an album,
     and which contains a set of tracks in a
   | particular order. The discs themselves within their containing
     album are also ordered. A disc never exists
   | outside of an album.

-  | **Track** An individual atomic recording captured on media. It is
     often digitized into a single file where
   | metadata can be embedded together with the encoded audio. Tracks
     can stand alone, or might be part of a
   | playlist, or disc.

-  | **Playlist** A collection of tracks, discs, albums, and other
     playlists. At its root it is an ordered set of
   | tracks where those tracks may be held in various subordinate
     containers. A playlist may also contain
   | artwork and additional metadata. What distinguishes it from an
     album is that does not represent something
   | published. Rather, it represents custom assemblies of music the
     user might make and share with others.

-  | **Central Repository** This refers to the central MusicBrainz
     database and associated services (mostly for
   | artwork. It has information about more tracks and albums than
     anyone could ever collect; being that it is
   | the union of the collections of all those who work with it.

-  | **Local Repository** A subset of the Central Repository holding
     data about those tracks and albums that the
   | local user has in all their Music Libraries. It also has
     information that links the data in the repository
   | to the physical media in those Music Libraries. In addition, it is
     responsible for understanding how the
   | local repository has changed relative to the Central Repository.

-  | **Music Library** A collection of media files organized in a
     particular hierarchical structure. Initially
   | this is simply the directory of the root of a collection of
     directories containing music files. However,
   | any filesystem like interface can be used so long as the program
     has some means to browse, read, and
   | optionally modify any of the files within it.
