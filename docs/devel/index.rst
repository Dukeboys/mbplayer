Why this project
----------------

It all started when I found Musicbrainz and decided to both add to the
Musicbrainz database with information from my collection (if there were
gaps) and to tag my music files to benefit from the rich data model that
Musicbrainz provides. One of the features I really like about
Musicbrainz is their support for a large number of "Cover" art images -
with tags to indicate is the artwork is part of a booklet. That sparked
my imagination to dream of bygone days when I would queue up one of my
favorite albums and then sit down to listen to it while perusing the
liner notes. I'm a lover of classical music and most of the better
albums came with a very detailed booklet describing the works being
performed, the performers, the venue and so on. I looked and looked and
nothing I found came close to supporting that experience. So I decided
to write it myself.
