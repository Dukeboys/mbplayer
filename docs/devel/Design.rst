MBPlayer Design
===============

Vision
------

| The main goal of this project is to create a Musicbrainz centric music
  player that has features that support the
| following "feel" (some of the younger folks reading this might have a
  hard time relating):

    | Picture yourself with your physical music collection in a room
      with a good stereo system. You carefully select
    | the album you want to listen to; put it on the phonograph player,
      turn it on and carefully place the needle on.
    | Then you take the album cover and liner and sit down in the
      perfect spot and start intensely listening to the
    | music. Drink it in; revel in it, immerse yourself in it. As you
      listen, you take out the liner notes - a nice
    | thick book full of background information on the composer, the
      performers, the nature of the work, and so on.
    | You listen and drink in the music and information about the music.
      Bliss.

| Now translate that experience to the modern age. With the rich
  database of Musicbrainz and their extensive links
| to background information, cover art, works, artists, recordings, etc.
  You have tools to help you locate just
| the music you want. You can examine the liner notes, examine the
  covers, filter your collection in a variety of
| ways. Then, once you've selected the music you want; you queue it up
  and start listening. But now you can
| peruse the information about the music being played. You can read the
  liner notes, look at the front and back
| covers. But you can also browse through all the data associated with
  each track - read about the artists, look
| at a picture of the place where the recording was made, find other
  performances of the same work.
