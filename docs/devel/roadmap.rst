Musicbrainz Player Roadmap
==========================

I have a pretty good idea of what I want the first prototype to be. Once
I get there and have something to play with, I'll start to follow a
work-through-the-enhancements-requests workflow. I'm going to put some
basic dates out there, but they are HIGHLY suspect since I don't know
all the technologies well so I doubt my estimates.
